	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {We develop a new method for blocking in randomized
		  experiments that works for an arbitrary number of
		  treatments. We analyze the following prob- lem: given a
		  threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained
		  in a block, and given a distance measure between any two
		  units in the finite population, block the units so that the
		  maximum distance between any two units within a block is
		  minimized. This blocking criterion can minimize covariate
		  imbalance, which is a common goal in experimental design.
		  Find- ing an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem.
		  However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the
		  first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking
		  algorithm for this problem. We derive the variances of
		  estimators for sample average treatment effects under the
		  Neyman-Rubin potential out- comes model for arbitrary
		  blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments.

		  education on civic engagement is relative, rather than
		  absolute. Education correlates with greater engagement
		  because it is a marker of social status; the degree of
		  status conferred by your level of education is determined
		  by the average level of education within your environment.
		  This article tests the sorting model by paying strict heed
		  to its assumptions. The analysis confirms the model, but
		  considerably narrows its reach. Sorting applies only to one
		  particular type (electoral activity), only when the
		  educational environment accounts for variation across age
		  and place, and only when one models the interactive
		  relationship between education at the individual and
		  environmental levels. Furthermore, sorting applies more to
		  men than women. The same analytical framework demonstrates
		  that being in a more highly educated environment amplifies
		  the relationship between education and democratic
		  enlightenment (political knowledge and tolerance).},
