One Page on Behavior Change

A person's behavior can improve either because they have had some experience with the desired behavior. The experience can be direct (like they’ve actually **done** the behavior at least once) or indirect (they’ve **seen** or heard about someone else doing that behavior). And of course, it makes no sense ethically or practically to attempt to create a new behavior that is not eventually self-reinforcing and producing positive outcomes for the person and society.

**If they can actually do the behavior,** then behavior change happens when they receive a reward for the behavior.^[Insert cites. One idea is to just cite [Don't Shoot the Dog](https://clickertraining.com/karen)]  The point of the reward is attention, not payment. The idea is to put the person in a situation where they are apt to do the desired behavior, watch for the behavior, and then give an attention grabbing reward immediately: the reward must be linked in the mind and dopamine system of the person to the behavior. Eventually, the rewards can be tapered away or removed because the behavior itself is its own reward.

**If they cannot actually do the behavior** and/or if the trainer/government/NGO cannot directly observe behavior to reward it directly and immediately anyway, then people can still change their behavior by watching other people do the behavior.  People have to (1) see or hear about the desired behavior, (2) imagine themselves doing this behavior, and (3) feel like doing the behavior would produce good outcomes for themselves or close others. People should adopt behaviors and attitudes if they see **multiple, relatable characters** [@kazdin1974covertModeling; @kazdin1976multipleModels; @bandura1977social] engaging in behaviors with **clear cause-effect linkages to outcomes they desire**. [@kazdin1974effectsAssertive; @blaisdell2006causal] They also need to see that the desired outcome wouldn't be caused by other behaviors.
